# NASA SpaceApps COVID-19 Hackathon

### This repo contains our work for the SpaceApps Hackathon. 

**Context**: In 2015 the UN created a set of goals (SDGs) to mark countries’ development. We are developing creative solutions that will help countries track COVID-19’s impact on the pursuit of the SDGs. We are to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the targets by looking at the current and ongoing changes in indicators such as remote sensing. Finally, we have to inform the general public by using Earth observations to track, quantify, and visualize the impact of COVID-19 on SDG targets and indicators.

**Topic:** SDG 11: Develop your own metric (indicator) to understand population mobility, where people are, who is most at risk, and other associated impacts.
